## üèÅ Final Words

Building Base PingPong Arena has been an exciting journey into the intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. The most rewarding aspect was creating a system where players can stake their ETH and compete for real rewards, all while owning and trading unique NFTs on the Base chain.

The biggest challenge was implementing a fair and transparent match result verification system that balances on-chain integrity with user experience. By developing a hybrid approach with admin verification showing actual game scores, I've created a solution that maintains the benefits of blockchain while addressing its limitations.

Migrating the project to Base chain was a smooth process thanks to Base's EVM compatibility and excellent developer tools. The Base ecosystem provides the perfect infrastructure for gaming applications with its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and growing user base.

I believe this project demonstrates the potential of Base for gaming applications and hope it inspires more developers to build engaging, skill-based games on the blockchain. The Base Hackathon has been a great opportunity to showcase how traditional gaming experiences can be enhanced through blockchain technology.
